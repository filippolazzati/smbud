This is the repository for the projects of the *Systems and Methods for Big and Unstructured Data* (SMBUD) course. The repo is divided in 3 different parts, according to the different projects.

## Project 1 - Graph databases
The first directory is about the implementation of a simple contact tracing app using [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/):
- In the *deliverables* folder you can find the pdf report of the project, along with the Latex code;
- In the *sample dataset and code* you can find the sample dataset as CSV files to place in the **import** directory of your [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/) database; moreover, you can also find the file with which you can initialize such dataset;
- In the *webapp* folder you can find a simple implementation of a client and a server that allow to work with this graph database.

## Project 2 - Document-oriented databases
The second directory is about the implementation of a simple database about vaccination certifications using [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/):
- In the *deliverables* folder you can find the pdf report of the project, along with the Latex code;
- In the *sample dataset and code* you can find the sample dataset as CSV files you have to import into your [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) database;
- In the *webapp* folder you can find a simple implementation of a client and a server that allow to work with this document-oriented database.

## Project 3
